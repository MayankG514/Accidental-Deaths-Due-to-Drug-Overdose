# Accidental-Deaths-Due-to-Drug-Overdose
With the increase in the rates of death across the globe due to overdose of external substances in human blood, we must pay attention to the cause of the concern on an immediate basis.
Increases in Drug and Opioid Overdose Deaths—United States, 2000–2014 [2] compares the change in death rate from the year 2000 to 2014 across all the states in the US. It uses demographic data such as age, sex, race Hispanic origin, and the states of origin. It compares the death numbers due to different types of drugs such as heroin, methadone, synthetic opioids excluding methadone, natural and semi-synthetic opioids, and drugs involving opioids. 
As a result of this report, I want to extract answers to the following research questions: ‘What type of drug causes what kind of death, and the count of deaths each drug caused to date?’, ‘What is the city-wise average age of people dying due to drug overdose ‘, and ‘What is the yearly trend of deaths due to drug overdose in different races?’.

The project consists of two parts : 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis using R programming
2. Statistical Modelling using python programming
